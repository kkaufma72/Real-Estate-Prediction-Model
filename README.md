Real Estate Price Prediction

Overview

This project aims to predict real estate prices based on various features such as size and number of bedrooms. It employs machine learning techniques to build predictive models that can assist real estate stakeholders in estimating property prices more accurately.

Features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and relationships within the dataset.
Feature engineering, including the addition of polynomial features to capture non-linear relationships.
Feature selection using RandomForestRegressor to identify the most relevant features for prediction.
Model ensemble approach, combining Ridge Regression and Random Forest for improved accuracy.
Advanced model evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score.
